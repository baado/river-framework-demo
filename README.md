[![Project Stats](https://www.openhub.net/p/river-framework/widgets/project_thin_badge.gif)](https://www.openhub.net/p/river-framework)

Demos for the River Framework project, an Object Document Mapper Framework written in Java. You will find a presentation about the project at its [website](http://www.riverframework.org/). About source code, current features, known issues, next features, etc., please visit its GitHub [repo](https://github.com/mariosotil/river-framework).


## Demo: Address Book
This is an Eclipse Project of a stand-alone Java program. It creates a local IBM Notes database, populates it with random data, and do a simple search. 

Features:
- It shows how to define a database (`AddressBook.class`) for an indexed document (`Person.class`)
- The `Person.java` file has defined all required and some optional methods.
- The `AddressBook.java` file has the minimum to use it with indexed documents. 


#### How install the demo?
You will need:
- An IBM Lotus Notes client installed. The Domino server is not necessary.
- Eclipse IDE for Java developers (I use [Luna](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/marsr))
  
About the demo:
- Create a Git clone or just download it as a ZIP file
- In Eclipse, import the project 
- Download the Maven artifacts
- Run it :-)
